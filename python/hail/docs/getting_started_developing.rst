Getting Started Developing
==========================

You'll need:

- `Java 8 JDK <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html>`_
- `Spark 2.0.2 <http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html>`_
- `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_

-------------------
Building a Hail JAR
-------------------

The minimal set of tools necessary to build Hail from source is a C++ compiler. On a Debian-based OS like Ubuntu, a C++ compiler can be installed with apt-get::

    sudo apt-get install g++

On Mac OS X, a C++ compiler is provided by the Apple Xcode::

    xcode-select --install

The Hail source code is hosted `on GitHub <https://github.com/broadinstitute/hail>`_::

    git clone https://github.com/broadinstitute/hail.git
    cd hail

You may also want to install `Seaborn <http://seaborn.pydata.org>`_, a Python library for statistical data visualization, using ``conda install seaborn`` or ``pip install seaborn``. While not technically necessary, Seaborn is used in the tutorials to make prettier plots.

A Hail JAR can be built using Gradle, note that every Hail JAR is specific to
one version of Spark::

    ./gradlew -Dspark.version=2.0.2 shadowJar

Finally, some environment variables must be set so that Hail can find Spark, Spark can find Hail, and Python can find Hail. Add these lines to your ``.bashrc`` or equivalent setting ``SPARK_HOME`` to the root directory of a Spark installation and ``HAIL_HOME`` to the root of the Hail repository::

    export SPARK_HOME=/path/to/spark
    export HAIL_HOME=/path/to/hail
    export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$HAIL_HOME/python:$SPARK_HOME/python:`echo $SPARK_HOME/python/lib/py4j*-src.zip`"
    export SPARK_CLASSPATH=$HAIL_HOME/build/libs/hail-all-spark.jar

Now you can import hail from a python interpreter::

    # python
    Python 2.7.12 |Anaconda custom (x86_64)| (default, Jul  2 2016, 17:43:17) 
    [GCC 4.2.1 (Based on Apple Inc. build 5658) (LLVM build 2336.11.00)] on darwin
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    Anaconda is brought to you by Continuum Analytics.

    >>> from hail import *
    >>> hc = HailContext()
    Using Spark's default log4j profile: org/apache/spark/log4j-defaults.properties
    Setting default log level to "WARN".
    To adjust logging level use sc.setLogLevel(newLevel).

-----------------
Building the Docs
-----------------

Hail uses `conda environments <https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html>`_ to
manage the doc build process's python dependencies. First, create a conda
environment for hail:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda env create haildoc -f ./python/hail/environment.yml

Activate the environment

.. code-block:: bash

    source activate haildoc

Now the shell prompt should include the name of the environment, in this case
"haildoc". Within the environment, run the ``createDocs`` gradle task in the
environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./gradlew createDocs

The generated docs are located at ``./build/www/hail/index.html``.

When you are finished developing hail, disable the environment

.. code-block:: bash

    source deactivate haildoc

The ``environment.yml`` file may change without warning; therefore, after
pulling new changes from a remote repository, we always recommend updating the
conda environment

.. code-block:: bash

    conda env update haildoc -f ./python/hail/environment.yml

-----------------
Running the tests
-----------------

Several Hail tests have additional dependencies:

 - `PLINK 1.9 <http://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2>`_

 - `QCTOOL 1.4 <http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~gav/qctool>`_

 - `R 3.3.1 <http://www.r-project.org/>`_ with packages ``jsonlite``, ``SKAT`` and ``logistf``.

Other recent versions of QCTOOL and R should suffice, but PLINK 1.7 will not.

To execute all Hail tests, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./gradlew -Dspark.version=${SPARK_VERSION} -Dspark.home=${SPARK_HOME} test
